feat: Implement manual content creation feature

This commit introduces a major new feature allowing users to create content manually in addition to using the AI generator.

**Frontend:**
- Adds "AI Generation" and "Manual Creation" tabs to the `GenerateContent.jsx` page.
- The "Manual Creation" tab includes a text area for post content and a drag-and-drop file uploader for images and videos with a preview.
- Implements the client-side logic to submit the manual post data to the new backend endpoint.

**Backend:**
- Adds a new endpoint `/api/content/create-manual` to `content.py`.
- This endpoint handles multipart/form-data to accept text and an optional media file.
- Uploads the media file to Google Cloud Storage.
- Saves the complete post (text, media URL, etc.) to Firestore.
- Decrements user credits for manual posts.

This provides users with the flexibility to create content in the way that best suits their workflow.
