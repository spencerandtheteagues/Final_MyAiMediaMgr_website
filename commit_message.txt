fix(backend): Add missing firestore import

This commit fixes a critical runtime error (`NameError: name 'firestore' is not defined`) that occurred during content generation. The `firestore` client library was being used to save posts to the database without being imported first.

This fix is bundled with all recent feature enhancements.
