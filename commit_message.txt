fix(deploy): Correct Gunicorn startup for Cloud Run

This commit resolves the container startup failure by implementing the correct Gunicorn configuration for a Flask application on Google Cloud Run.

- Removes the `if __name__ == '__main__':` block from `src/main.py`, as it is not used by a production WSGI server.
- Updates the `entrypoint.sh` script to use the correct `gunicorn --bind 0.0.0.0:$PORT` command, ensuring the application listens on the correct network interface and port provided by the Cloud Run environment.
- Adjusts the `gunicorn` command to use `src.main:app` to correctly locate the Flask app instance.
