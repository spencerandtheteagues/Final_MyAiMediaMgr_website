fix(video): Implement correct video generation with preview SDK

This commit resolves all remaining video generation issues by refactoring the implementation to use the correct preview modules and classes from the Vertex AI SDK.

- Replaces all incorrect `Model` and `VideoGenerationModel` imports.
- The `generate_video_content` function now correctly imports `GenerativeModel` from `vertexai.preview.generative_models`.
- Instantiates the model with a valid, available Veo model name (`veo-2.0-generate-001`).
- Uses the standard `generate_content` method, which correctly handles the long-running operation and GCS output for video models when called from the preview module.

This is the definitive fix that aligns the application's behavior with the specific requirements of the Veo preview API.
