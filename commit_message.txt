revert(frontend): Revert GenerateContent.jsx to fix rendering error

This commit reverts the `GenerateContent.jsx` file to a previous stable state to fix a critical rendering error that was causing a blank white screen.

The manual upload feature, which was the source of the bug, will be re-implemented in a separate, more careful commit after the application is stable.
