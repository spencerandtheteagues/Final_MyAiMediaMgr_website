fix(deploy): Separate migrations into Cloud Build step

This commit resolves the container startup failure by adopting the best practice of running database migrations in a dedicated Cloud Build step instead of the application's entrypoint script.

- **`cloudbuild.yaml`:** A new build step has been added to run `flask db upgrade` after the container image is built but before it is deployed. This step is configured with access to the `DATABASE_URL` secret.
- **`entrypoint.sh`:** The script has been simplified to only be responsible for starting the Gunicorn web server. The fragile migration and seeding commands have been removed.

This creates a more robust and reliable deployment pipeline, ensuring that the application container's only responsibility is to run the application itself.
