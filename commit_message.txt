fix(frontend): Restore missing helper functions in GenerateContent

This commit fixes a critical rendering error that caused a blank white screen on the Content Generation page. The error was a `ReferenceError` caused by the `handleSelectAll` and other helper functions being accidentally removed.

This fix restores the following functions:
- `handlePlatformToggle`
- `handleSelectAll`
- `handleTemplateSelect`
- `getSelectedPlatformNames`

This change makes the AI Generation tab functional again.
