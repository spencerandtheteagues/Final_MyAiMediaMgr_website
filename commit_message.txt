feat(backend): Implement cost-saving models and financial guardrails

This commit implements critical changes based on a detailed financial analysis to ensure the application's profitability and fix the persistent content generation failures.

**Core Fixes:**
- **Text Generation:** The AI model has been updated from the retired `gemini-1.0-pro` to the currently supported and cost-effective `gemini-2.0-flash`. This resolves the `404 Publisher Model not found` error.
- **Video Generation:** The conceptual video generation logic has been updated to specify the use of "Veo 3 Fast (video-only)" as the default, aligning with the cost-optimization strategy.

**Documentation:**
- The `todo.md` has been updated to include future financial guardrail features, such as in-product credit top-ups and using cheaper "Fast" models for image previews.

This commit bundles all recent feature work, including the manual upload feature, icon unification, and dashboard personalization.
