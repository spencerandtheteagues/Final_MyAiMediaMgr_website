fix(deploy): Use correct builder for migration step

This commit fixes a Cloud Build failure by specifying the correct builder image for the database migration step.

The `gcr.io/cloud-builders/gcloud` image does not include the Docker CLI, which was causing the `docker run` command to fail. The build step has been updated to use the `gcr.io/cloud-builders/docker` image, which provides the necessary tools to execute the migration container.
