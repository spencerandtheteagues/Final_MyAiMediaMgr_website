fix(video): Implement correct low-level Veo API call

This commit resolves all remaining video generation issues by refactoring the implementation to match the official REST API documentation for the Veo model.

- Replaces the high-level `GenerativeModel` abstraction with a generic `vertexai.Model` instance.
- Implements a call to the `predict_long_running` method, which is the correct Python SDK equivalent for the `predictLongRunning` REST endpoint required by Veo.
- Constructs the `instances` and `parameters` payload as a Python dictionary that exactly matches the documented JSON structure, including `storageUri` and `durationSeconds`.
- Handles the `operation.result()` and correctly parses the protobuf prediction object to extract the final GCS URI.

This is the definitive fix that aligns the application's behavior with the specific requirements of the Veo API.
