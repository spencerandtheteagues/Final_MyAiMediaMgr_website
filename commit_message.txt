feat(frontend): Personalize dashboard and add manual uploads

This commit includes several major frontend enhancements:

- **Dashboard Personalization:** The user display name in the bottom-left of the layout now shows the capitalized username of the logged-in user instead of a generic "User".
- **Manual Content Creation:** Implements a new "Manual Creation" tab on the Generate Content page, allowing users to write their own posts and upload media files directly.
- **Official SVG Icons:** Replaces all placeholder social media icons (.png, .jpg, emojis) with official, high-quality SVG logos for a consistent and professional UI.

**Backend:**
- Adds a new endpoint `/api/content/create-manual` to support the manual upload feature.
