fix(deploy): Correct gunicorn port binding in entrypoint

This commit fixes a container startup failure on Cloud Run.

The `gunicorn` command in `entrypoint.sh` was using an incorrect `--bind` syntax (`:$PORT`). This has been corrected to `--bind 0.0.0.0:$PORT` to properly listen on the port provided by the Cloud Run environment.
