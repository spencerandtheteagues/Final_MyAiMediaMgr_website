feat(frontend): Replace social media icons with official SVGs

Replaces all placeholder social media icons (.png, .jpg, emojis, and lucide-react icons) with official, high-quality SVG logos. This ensures a consistent, clear, and professional look across the application.

- Replaced icon files in `src/assets/social-icons/`.
- Updated `ApprovalQueue.jsx` to use the new SVGs.
- Updated `GenerateContent.jsx` to use the new SVGs.
- Updated `Platforms.jsx` to use the new SVGs for consistency.
