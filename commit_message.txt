fix(frontend): Restore handleGenerate function in GenerateContent

This commit fixes a critical bug where the "Generate Content" button was unresponsive. The `handleGenerate` function, which is responsible for calling the AI content generation API, was accidentally replaced with a placeholder comment.

This fix restores the full implementation of the `handleGenerate` function, making the AI content generation feature functional again.
