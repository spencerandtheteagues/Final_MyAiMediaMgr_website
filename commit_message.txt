fix(video): Implement definitive video generation fix

This commit resolves all remaining video generation issues by refactoring the implementation to use the correct preview modules and classes from the Vertex AI SDK, and forcing a library version upgrade.

- Updates `requirements.txt` to use `google-cloud-aiplatform>=1.55.0` to ensure the necessary `preview` modules are available in the build environment.
- Replaces all incorrect `Model` and `VideoGenerationModel` imports.
- The `generate_video_content` function now correctly imports `VideoGenerationModel` from `vertexai.preview.vision_models`.
- Instantiates the model with a valid, available Veo model name (`veo-3.0-fast-generate-preview`).
- Uses the `generate()` and `load()` methods to correctly handle the video generation and retrieval of video bytes.
- Implements the correct pattern of uploading the generated video bytes to GCS and creating a signed URL for the frontend.

This is the definitive fix that aligns the application's behavior with the specific requirements of the Veo preview API.
