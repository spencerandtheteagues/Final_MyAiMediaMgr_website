refactor(video): Unify AI client initialization under Vertex AI SDK

This commit refactors the video generation functionality to align with the application's established architecture for AI model interaction.

- Removes the `google-genai` library and its separate API key authentication, which was causing errors.
- All generative AI calls (Image, Video, Text) are now consistently handled by the `vertexai` library, using Application Default Credentials (ADC) for authentication.
- The `generate_video_content` function now uses the `VideoGenerationModel` from `vertexai.preview.vision_models`, mirroring the working logic of the image generation.

This change resolves the `ValueError: output_gcs_uri parameter is not supported in Gemini API` by ensuring all API calls correctly target the Vertex AI platform.
