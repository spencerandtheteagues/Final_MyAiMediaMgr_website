fix(deploy): Implement definitive Cloud Build pipeline

This commit resolves all remaining deployment issues by implementing the correct, robust CI/CD pipeline for a Flask application on Google Cloud Run.

- **`cloudbuild.yaml`:**
  - The migration step now correctly uses the `gcr.io/google.com/cloudsdktool/cloud-sdk` builder, which contains both the `gcloud` and `docker` CLIs.
  - The `docker run` command for the migration now includes the `--network=cloudbuild` flag to ensure connectivity.
  - The final deployment step is streamlined.
- **`entrypoint.sh`:**
  - The script is now simplified to only start the Gunicorn server, making the container's purpose singular and reliable.

This is the definitive fix that establishes a production-grade deployment pipeline.
