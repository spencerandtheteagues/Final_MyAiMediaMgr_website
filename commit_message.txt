fix(video): Correct generic Model import for Veo API call

This commit fixes a container startup crash caused by an `AttributeError`.

The `vertexai.Model` class was being called incorrectly. The import statement has been corrected to `from vertexai.generative_models import Model` to properly load the generic model class required for the low-level `predict_long_running` API call to the Veo model.
