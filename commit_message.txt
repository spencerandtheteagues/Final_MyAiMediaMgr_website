fix(video): Correct video generation with preview GenerativeModel

This commit resolves the container startup failure and implements the correct, unified approach for video generation.

- Replaces the incorrect `VideoGenerationModel` import with the correct `GenerativeModel` from `vertexai.preview.generative_models`.
- Updates the video generation logic to use the standard `generate_content` method with the `veo-2.0-generate-001` model, aligning it with the latest SDK practices for preview models.
- All AI generation now consistently uses the `vertexai` library with Application Default Credentials, removing the last remnants of the separate `google-genai` and API key configuration.

This change fixes the `ImportError` and ensures that video generation targets the Vertex AI platform correctly.
