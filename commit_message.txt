fix(backend): Correct GCS public access method

This commit fixes a runtime error (`Cannot get legacy ACL`) that occurred during manual file uploads. The error was caused by an attempt to use `blob.make_public()` on a Google Cloud Storage bucket with Uniform Bucket-Level Access enabled.

The fix removes the deprecated `blob.make_public()` call. The public access is now correctly handled by granting the `Storage Object Viewer` role to `allUsers` on the bucket itself.
