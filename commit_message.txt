fix(deploy): Use correct builder for migration step

This commit fixes a Cloud Build failure by specifying the correct builder image for the database migration step.

The `gcr.io/cloud-builders/docker` image does not include the `gcloud` CLI, which was causing the secret access command to fail. The build step has been updated to use the `gcr.io/google.com/cloudsdktool/cloud-sdk` image, which provides both the `gcloud` and `docker` CLIs.
